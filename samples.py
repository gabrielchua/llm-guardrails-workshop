    "Public sector report card: Singapore has made progress in key areas from education to housing  Amid efforts to forge a refreshed social compact where everyone gets a fair shot in life, more opportunities have been created for Singaporeans of any age, according to official figures.  The Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review 2024, released by the Ministry of Finance on Nov 1, cited outcomes from early education to employment and retirement to illustrate progress in key areas.  In early education, for instance, the number of full-day pre-school places has increased to more than 200,000 to meet demand.  When it came to jobs, the employment rate of residents aged 25 to 64 was 82.6 per cent in 2023 compared with the pre-Covid-19 pandemic level of 80.8 per cent in 2019.  There was also a steady supply of jobs in growth sectors, with 56.3 per cent of newly created positions in 2023 for professional, managerial, executive and technical (PMET) workers.  The share of employed residents in these PMET jobs also rose – from 58.4 per cent in 2019 to 62.6 per cent in 2023.  This snapshot of the opportunities created for people is part of a biennial review, which takes stock of how Singapore has fared in key areas of national interest.  Besides opportunities for all, it covered three other broad themes: quality and sustainable living, the shared future and Singapore’s place in the world, and a strong and resilient economy.  Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also Finance Minister, said in a Facebook post that tracking these key outcomes ensures that Singapore’s development continues to be balanced, inclusive and sustainable. He added: “On the whole, we have made good progress. But there are still areas to improve and to do better. Together we can continue to push new frontiers, and take Singapore forward.”  Painting a generally positive picture, the review said good progress had been made under these broad themes, which covered areas such as education, health, housing, diplomacy and the economy.  Head of civil service Leo Yip said: “(The review) underscores the strides Singapore has made in key areas of national interest – with more opportunities for citizens, a quality living environment, a safe and secure Singapore, as well as a strong and resilient economy.”  When it came to housing, which had seen some delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, waiting times for Housing Board flats have gone down from about five years in 2022 to three years and 10 months in 2023, said the review.  As at September 2024, about 94 per cent of flats delayed because of the pandemic have been completed, and the remaining delayed projects are on track for completion by early 2025.  As a result, the average application rates for Build-To-Order flats – which is the total number of applications received, divided by the total BTO supply in the year – have fallen to 2.9 in 2023. This is down from a high of 5.8 in 2022, and below the pre-pandemic level of 3.7 in 2019.  In the area of health, Singaporeans continued to have one of the longest life expectancies in the world, with life expectancy at birth at 87.7 for females and 83.6 for males, and health-adjusted life expectancy at birth at 75.9 for females and 73.9 for males in 2021.  Progress has also been made in reducing the prevalence of high cholesterol and diabetes between 2017 and 2022, though the prevalence of obesity and high blood pressure went up during the same period.  Meanwhile, median waiting times for adults in public hospitals rose sharply from two hours in 2019 to 7.2 hours in 2023.  The review said this was due to an ageing population, the growing number of patients with complex health needs, and delays in healthcare infrastructure projects due to the pandemic.  On this front, the Government has continued to invest in healthcare infrastructure, noted the review, and is working to increase the number of public hospital beds in acute and community hospitals from 11,000 as at the end of 2023 to 15,000 in 2030.  Undergirding these outcomes, economic fundamentals have remained robust and continued to be strengthened despite a challenging external environment, said the review. Between 2019 and 2023, Singapore’s real gross domestic product grew at 2.6 per cent a year.  This year’s review also highlighted some areas in which Singaporeans have partnered one another and the Government to “own, shape and act on our shared future together”, following from the Forward Singapore (Forward SG) exercise to renew Singapore’s social compact. For instance, the exercise brought more than 200,000 Singaporeans together to chart a road map for the nation’s next stage of development.  Through the Mentoring SG movement, individuals, businesses and other organisations have also come together to make mentoring more accessible to young people. As at September 2024, Mentoring SG has engaged more than 2,500 skilled mentors and connected more than 6,000 youth to mentoring networks and resources.   Mr Yip said it was heartening to see the Government, Singaporeans and businesses coming together to develop and implement initiatives that support and uplift the community. “The public service remains committed to working with Singaporeans to address gaps and to build our shared future together,” he added.",
    "Singapore's fifth wildlife park to open in March 2025  Visitors to Singapore's fifth wildlife park can look forward to trekking through a sprawling rainforest filled with 29 animal species and various adventure elements.   The new park, Rainforest Wild, will launch its first phase known as Rainforest Wild Asia in March next year, according to Mandai Wildlife Group.  It will be the first adventure-based zoological park in Asia.    Inspired by treks through rainforests, the 13ha Rainforest Wild Asia at Mandai Wildlife Reserve was designed to include a variety of paths with different levels of difficulty, allowing guests to tailor their visit according to their preferences.   These include forest trails scattered with fallen logs, boulders and streams, as well as elevated walkways, said Mandai Wildlife Group in a press release on Thursday (Nov 7).  The elevated walkways, which include sheltered rest stops, will be accessible to families with strollers and wheelchair users.   “Those seeking adrenaline-pumping experiences can purchase harnessed experiences and guided tours offering high-element traverses across rock faces, freefall jumps and challenging caving adventures,” added Mandai Wildlife Group.  To create Rainforest Wild Asia's landscape, close to 7,000 Southeast Asian trees and shrubs were planted to supplement the existing protected patches of rainforest.   'Visitors are advised to don comfortable shoes and bring a sense of adventure for their rainforest explorations,' said Mandai Wildlife Group.

(Image: Mandai Wildlife Group) FLEXIBLE HABITATS FOR WILDLIFE  Rainforest Wild Asia will be home to animals such as the Malayan tiger, sun bear and Javan langur.   It will also host “new-to-Singapore” species such as the threatened Francois langur and the Philippine spotted deer, said Mandai Wildlife Group.  The park’s wildlife will roam through 'extensive habitats', giving guests the chance to witness them thrive in distinct rainforest settings, said Mike Barclay, group CEO of Mandai Wildlife Group.  “Most importantly, we hope to create strong feelings of connection to nature and a renewed determination to cherish and protect our planet.”  Flexible habitats will also be introduced at Rainforest Wild Asia for the first time, said Mandai Wildlife Group.  Different animals, such as red dholes and babirusas, will be featured at various times of the day.   Such habitats will 'provide stimulating environments for the animals, encouraging natural behaviours while allowing visitors to observe these behaviours', said Mandai Wildlife Group. A 'MULTI-LAYERED' RAINFOREST ADVENTURE  Paths above and below ground will be featured across Rainforest Wild Asia’s 10 different zones.  For example, the park's 'Rock Cascade' will have an elevated walkway from which visitors can view the Malayan tiger exhibit.    Visitors will be able to watch the tigers wander through tunnels and navigate rocky formations and waterfalls.  At the 'Watering Hole', the park's largest zone, visitors might have a chance to catch Malayan sun bears foraging in the trees and Malayan tapirs roaming the forest floor.   For a glimpse into life at the treetops, guests can visit 'The Canopy' for encounters with free-ranging animals such as the Javan langur, red-shanked douc langur and siamang.  Visitors can also purchase 'Adventure Plus' experiences such as the 'Canopy Jump', where participants can step off a 13m or 20m-high platform and freefall before safely transitioning into a controlled descent.  The next phase of the park to open - Rainforest Wild Africa - is inspired by the landscapes of the Afro-Tropical region and Madagascar, Mandai Wildlife Group added.",
    "More Skytrain cars, Terminal 3 upgrade part of Changi Airport’s S$3 billion enhancement plan  The addition of Skytrain cars and the upgrading of Terminal 3 are among Changi Airport’s initiatives to update its infrastructure to meet the rising demand for air travel.   The airport is also set to expand its arrival immigration halls and check-in facilities, and introduce a new rooftop inter-terminal baggage conveyance system.   A total of S$3 billion (US$2.26 billion) will be invested over the next six years in these projects, with funding coming from an increase in airport fees, the airport and Singapore’s aviation authority said at a media briefing on Thursday (Nov 7).   These investments are essential for Changi to stay “strategically ahead of the game”, said Mr Koh Ming Sue, executive vice-president of engineering and development at Changi Airport Group (CAG).   The airport’s traffic has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels, with more than 65 million passengers being handled between October 2023 to September 2024. This is already higher than the 58.9 million passenger movements in 2023, and close to the 68.3 million seen in 2019.   Without upgrading Changi Airport’s infrastructure, local airlines will not be able to grow in the coming years, said CAG CEO Yam Kum Weng. If demand exceeds airlines' capabilities, airfares are likely to increase, he added.   “So that's the reason why we wanted to invest in this infrastructure to create a capacity for airlines to grow so that you got more flights and more frequencies and to also more destinations,” Mr Yam said.  MORE SKYTRAIN CARS The Skytrain's subsystems, including its signalling and communications systems, will be replaced to improve operational performance. (Photo: Changi Airport Group)  Changi Airport will add seven new cars to its Skytrain system to minimise waiting times and carry more passengers travelling between Terminals 1, 2 and 3.   The airport currently has 22 Skytrain cars, each with a 50-passenger capacity. The new cars will be added by 2026 and will operate until the late 2030s before the entire system is overhauled.   “Singapore is an international air hub, and transfer and transit passengers (are) a critical component of our air hub. It augments the domestic demand and allows the Singapore air hub to have flight connections to many more cities, and to have these connections a lot more frequently,” said Mr Han Kok Juan, the director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).  Various Skytrain subsystems, including its signalling and communications systems, will also be replaced as they are nearing end-of-life after operating since 2008. TERMINAL 3 UPGRADES Terminal 3's baggage handling system will be upgraded to enhance its capacity, resilience and efficiency. (Photo: Changi Airport Group)  Opened in 2008, Terminal 3 will see improvements to its systems and terminal facilities to improve the passenger experience there and provide a boost to its retail businesses.   “Over the course of the last 10 years, Changi Airport Group has built Terminal 4, upgraded and expanded Terminals 1 and 2 successively. We are planning to do the same for Terminal 3, which has been operating for nearly 20 years without a major refresh,” said Mr Koh, adding that more details will be provided in the future.   To assist with the growing amount of baggage from an increase in passenger numbers, Terminal 3’s early bag storage subsystem will be revamped to hold 65 per cent more baggage.  This will allow 10,000 bags to be held across all four terminals by 2029, an increase from the 8,000 bags currently, CAG said in a media release, adding that Terminals 1 and 2 will also benefit from Terminal 3’s bigger storage system.   Changi Airport will also construct a new rooftop inter-terminal conveyance system to transfer baggage from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3.  Mr Koh explained that the volume of inter-terminal baggage movement is getting very high, and both systems together will be able to hold 4,000 bags come 2029.  “This will ease the demand on the current underground system and reduce manpower needed for the towing of baggage,” CAG and CAAS said in a media release.  OTHER ENHANCEMENTS Selected contact stands will be upgraded and some taxiways will be strengthened to handle the operational demands of the new B779 family of planes. (Photo: Changi Airport Group)  By the end of this year, Terminal 4 will have a new check-in row that will facilitate fast and easy travel through self-service check-in kiosks and automated bag drops.   The new facilities will increase the terminal’s check-in volume by approximately 15 per cent and will accommodate up to 2,500 passengers per hour.   Terminal 1’s east and west arrival immigration halls will also be expanded by almost 60 per cent by 2026.   “The larger space will relieve the key bottlenecks for arrival clearance, especially during peak periods,” CAG and CAAS  said.   CAG and CAAS also said that the construction of Terminal 5 will begin in 2025 and it will be operational in the mid-2030s.   When operational, Terminal 5 will serve an additional 50 million passengers annually, on top of Changi Airport’s current capacity of 90 million.   “As a major air hub for the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, Changi Airport is well-poised to serve this rise in demand and provide even better connectivity to travellers,” said Mr Han.   Airside infrastructure will also be improved to accommodate Boeing’s new B779 family of planes.   Known to be the world’s longest twin-engine aircraft, the B779 has a wheel load that will put more stress on aircraft pavements. Hence, some taxiways will have to be reinforced and contact stands upgraded.   The airport currently has 111 contact stands and 78 remote stands. Thirty-seven of the contact stands can currently accommodate the B779, and this will increase to 39 in 2028.   As more planes use the airport to meet the influx of travellers, it will also construct more remote aircraft parking stands for both passengers and cargo. This will bring the total number of aircraft stands to more than 200.  MANPOWER INITIATIVES   Changi Airport will also invest in facilities to improve the safety and well-being of its workers, such as refresh pods to combat heat stress, improved lightning shelters and better staff loungers and rest areas.  Ground staff will also get more opportunities to upskill and take on higher-value roles.  Meanwhile, trials will be conducted where artificial intelligence will be used for security screening and to increase automation in the airport’s ground handling operations.  Such initiatives will be undertaken due to manpower constraints, said Mr Yam.  “We know that manpower constraint is a major challenge for many airports, and all the more so for Singapore because of our ageing population,” he said.   “The deployment of digital systems and automation will enhance our airline partners’ operational efficiency and productivity.",
