# Example App Demonstrating Guardrail Techniques

This is the example app that was built during the workshop.

In this application, we make a cover letter generator given a resume and job description.

## Set-up

It shares the same set-up (i.e., same `requirements.txt`, same secrets) as the main app. Please refer to the [main README](../README.md) for more details.
